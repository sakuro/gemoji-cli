# Ruby Gem Release Workflows

A set of GitHub Actions workflows for automating Ruby gem releases using RubyGems Trusted Publishing (OIDC authentication).

## Overview

This repository contains four GitHub Actions workflows that provide a complete CI/CD pipeline for Ruby gems:

1. **CI Workflow** - Continuous integration testing
2. **Release Preparation** - Automated release branch and PR creation
3. **Release Validation** - Pre-merge release checks
4. **Release Publishing** - Automated gem publishing to RubyGems.org

## Workflows

### 1. CI Workflow (`ci.yml`)

Runs tests and quality checks across multiple Ruby versions.

**Triggers:**
- Push to `main` branch
- Pull requests

**Matrix Testing:**
- Tests against the latest 3 supported Ruby versions
- See [Ruby Maintenance Branches](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/branches/) for current supported versions

**Steps:**
- Checks out code
- Sets up Ruby with bundler cache
- Runs `bundle exec rake` (default task)

### 2. Release Preparation Workflow (`release-preparation.yml`)

Creates a release branch with updated version files and opens a pull request.

**Trigger:**
- Manual dispatch with version input (e.g., `1.0.0`)

**Actions:**
- Creates release branch `release-v{version}`
- Updates `lib/{gem_name}/version.rb` with new version
- Updates `CHANGELOG.md`:
  - Converts `[Unreleased]` to versioned section with date
  - Adds new `[Unreleased]` section for future changes
- Creates git tag `v{version}`
- Pushes branch and tag to remote
- Creates pull request with detailed checklist

**Requirements:**
- Repository permissions: `contents: write`, `pull-requests: write`

### 3. Release Validation Workflow (`release-validation.yml`)

Validates release PRs to ensure everything is correct before merging.

**Trigger:**
- Pull requests to `main` branch (only for `release-v*` branches)

**Validations:**
- Version format (must be `x.y.z`)
- Version consistency between branch name and `version.rb`
- Git tag existence check
- RubyGems version availability check
- CHANGELOG.md format validation

**Special Features:**
- Automatically updates git tag to latest commit when PR is updated
- Ensures tagged commit is always the one that will be published

**Requirements:**
- Repository permissions: `contents: write`

### 4. Release Publishing Workflow (`release-publish.yml`)

Publishes the gem to RubyGems.org and creates a GitHub release when a release PR is merged.

**Trigger:**
- Pull request closure (only when merged and from `release-v*` branches)

**Actions:**
- Extracts version from branch name
- Checks out the release tag
- Builds gem with `bundle exec rake build`
- Configures RubyGems credentials using Trusted Publishing
- Pushes gem to RubyGems.org
- Extracts version-specific changelog
- Creates GitHub release with changelog and gem file

**Requirements:**
- Repository permissions: `contents: write`, `id-token: write`
- Environment: `release` (configured in GitHub repository settings)
- RubyGems Trusted Publishing configured

## Initial Setup

### 0. Install Workflows to Your Repository

**Using git archive and tar (recommended):**

```bash
# Navigate to your target gem repository
cd /path/to/your-gem

# Create .github/workflows directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p .github/workflows

# Copy all files (workflows and README) using git archive
git -C /path/to/gem-workflows archive HEAD | tar -C .github/workflows -xv

# Verify files were copied
ls -la .github/workflows/
```

**Alternative: Manual copy:**

```bash
# Copy files manually
cp /path/to/gem-workflows/*.yml /path/to/your-gem/.github/workflows/
```

**Note:** `git archive --remote` does not work with HTTPS protocol (e.g., GitHub). Use the local clone method or manual copy instead.

After copying the workflows, commit them to your repository:

```bash
git add .github/workflows/
git commit -m "Add release automation workflows"
git push
```

### 1. Repository Settings

Configure GitHub repository permissions at `https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/settings/actions`:

1. **Workflow permissions**: Set to "Read and write permissions"
2. **Pull request permissions**: Enable "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"

### 2. RubyGems Trusted Publishing

Configure OIDC authentication for secure, token-less gem publishing:

1. Go to https://rubygems.org/oidc/pending_trusted_publishers
2. Create a new pending trusted publisher with:
   - **Gem name**: `{your_gem_name}`
   - **Repository owner**: `{github_username}`
   - **Repository name**: `{repository_name}`
   - **Workflow filename**: `release-publish.yml`
   - **Environment name**: `release`

3. The pending publisher will automatically convert to an active publisher after the first successful gem push.

**Note:** Trusted Publishing works seamlessly with MFA enabled on RubyGems.org. You can safely use "UI and API" MFA level without breaking CI/CD.

Reference: https://guides.rubygems.org/trusted-publishing/releasing-gems/

### 3. GitHub Environment

Create a `release` environment at `https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/settings/environments`:

1. Click "New environment"
2. Name it `release`
3. (Optional) Add protection rules or required reviewers

### 4. Project Structure

Ensure your project has the following structure:

```
your-gem/
├── lib/
│   └── {gem_name}/
│       └── version.rb        # Contains VERSION constant
├── CHANGELOG.md              # Keep a Changelog format
├── Rakefile                  # With build task
└── .github/
    └── workflows/
        ├── ci.yml
        ├── release-preparation.yml
        ├── release-validation.yml
        └── release-publish.yml
```

**version.rb** should contain:
```ruby
module YourGem
  VERSION = "0.1.0"
end
```

**CHANGELOG.md** should follow [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) format:
```markdown
## [Unreleased]

### Added
- New feature descriptions

## [0.1.0] - 2024-01-15
- Initial release
```

## Release Procedure

### Step 1: Prepare for Release

1. Ensure all changes are merged to `main` branch
2. Update `CHANGELOG.md` with changes in the `[Unreleased]` section
3. Commit and push changes to `main`

### Step 2: Trigger Release Preparation

**Option A: Using GitHub UI**

1. Go to Actions tab in your repository
2. Select "Release Preparation" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Enter the version number (e.g., `1.0.0`)
5. Click "Run workflow"

**Option B: Using GitHub CLI**

```bash
gh workflow run release-preparation.yml -f version=1.0.0
```

The workflow will:
- Create a release branch
- Update version files
- Create a git tag
- Open a pull request

### Step 3: Review the Release PR

**Finding the Pull Request:**

```bash
# Find PR for the release branch
gh pr list --head release-v1.0.0

# Or view it directly in the browser
gh pr view --web --head release-v1.0.0
```

1. Review the automatically created pull request
2. Check the "Files changed" tab to verify:
   - `version.rb` has the correct version
   - `CHANGELOG.md` has the correct date and format
3. CI and validation workflows will run automatically
4. Review the checklist in the PR description

**Important:** If you push new commits to the release branch, the validation workflow will automatically update the git tag to point to the latest commit.

### Step 4: Merge and Publish

**Finding and Merging the Release PR:**

```bash
# Check PR status and CI results
gh pr view release-v1.0.0

# Check if all checks have passed
gh pr checks release-v1.0.0

# Get PR number and branch name for merge commit message
PR_NUMBER=$(gh pr view release-v1.0.0 --json number -q .number)
BRANCH_NAME=$(gh pr view release-v1.0.0 --json headRepositoryOwner,headRefName -q '.headRepositoryOwner.login + "/" + .headRefName')

# Merge the PR with proper commit message
gh pr merge release-v1.0.0 --merge --subject ":inbox_tray: Merge pull request #$PR_NUMBER from $BRANCH_NAME"

# Or use other merge strategies (if project conventions require):
# gh pr merge release-v1.0.0 --squash   # Squash and merge
# gh pr merge release-v1.0.0 --rebase   # Rebase and merge
```

**Option: Using GitHub UI**

1. Once all checks pass and requirements are met, merge the PR from the GitHub web interface

**After Merging:**

The Release Publishing workflow will automatically:
- Build the gem from the tagged commit
- Publish to RubyGems.org using Trusted Publishing
- Create a GitHub release with changelog and gem file

### Step 5: Verify Publication

1. Check RubyGems.org: `https://rubygems.org/gems/{gem_name}`
2. Check GitHub releases: `https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/releases`
3. Verify the published version: `gem list {gem_name} --remote`

## Troubleshooting

### Release Preparation Fails

**Problem:** "Version already exists on RubyGems"
- **Solution:** The version has already been published. Use a higher version number.

**Problem:** "Git tag already exists"
- **Solution:** The tag was created outside the release process. Delete it or use a different version.

### Release Validation Fails

**Problem:** "Version mismatch"
- **Solution:** Ensure the version in `version.rb` matches the version in the branch name.

**Problem:** "CHANGELOG.md missing section"
- **Solution:** Ensure CHANGELOG.md has a section for the release version.

### Release Publishing Fails

**Problem:** "Trusted Publishing authentication failed"
- **Solution:** Verify the pending trusted publisher configuration on RubyGems.org matches your repository settings.

**Problem:** "Missing permissions"
- **Solution:** Check that repository workflow permissions are set to "Read and write permissions".

**Problem:** "Environment not found"
- **Solution:** Create the `release` environment in repository settings.

## Security Considerations

- **No API tokens required**: Trusted Publishing uses OIDC, eliminating the need for long-lived API tokens
- **MFA compatible**: Works seamlessly with RubyGems MFA requirements
- **Principle of least privilege**: Workflows only request necessary permissions
- **Tag immutability**: Once a release is published, the git tag represents the exact code that was published

## Maintenance

### Updating Ruby Versions

Check [Ruby Maintenance Branches](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/branches/) for currently supported versions.

When updating supported Ruby versions, you need to modify three workflow files:

**1. Update CI matrix** in `ci.yml`:

```yaml
matrix:
  ruby:
    - 'X.Y'
    - 'X.Y'
    - 'X.Y'  # Latest supported versions
```

**2. Update minimum Ruby version** in `release-validation.yml`:

```yaml
- name: Set up Ruby
  uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1
  with:
    ruby-version: 'X.Y'  # Minimum supported version
    bundler-cache: true
```

**3. Update minimum Ruby version** in `release-publish.yml`:

```yaml
- name: Set up Ruby
  uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1
  with:
    ruby-version: 'X.Y'  # Minimum supported version
    bundler-cache: true
```

**Important:** When dropping support for older Ruby versions, update the `ruby-version` in both `release-validation.yml` and `release-publish.yml` to the new minimum supported version. This ensures gem building and publishing use a supported Ruby version.
